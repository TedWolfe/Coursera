    <div class="col-lg4 col-md6 col-sm12"><em id="p1">What is Lorem Ipsum?</em>
<p>
Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book.  Publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.

<div class="row">
    <div class="col-lg4 col-md6 col-sm12"><em id="p2">Where can I get some?</em>
<p>
There are many variations of passages of Lorem Ipsum available, but the majority have suffered alteration in some form, by injected humour, or randomised words which don't look even slightly believable.  The generated Lorem Ipsum is therefore always free from repetition, injected humour, or non-characteristic words etc.

<div class="row">
    <div class="col-lg4 col-md12 col-sm12"><em id="p3">Why do we use it?</em>
<p>
It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it look like readable English.
